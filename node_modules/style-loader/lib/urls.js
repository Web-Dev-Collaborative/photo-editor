 * When source maps are enabled, `style-loader` uses a link element with a data-uri to
 * embed the css on the page. This breaks all relative urls because now they are relative to a
 * bundle instead of the current page.
 *
 * One solution is to only use full urls, but that may be impossible.
 *
 * Instead, this function "fixes" the relative urls to be absolute according to the current page location.
 *
 * A rudimentary test suite is located at `test/fixUrls.js` and can be run via the `npm test` command.
