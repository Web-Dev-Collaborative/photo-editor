> A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / fsevents.

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on OS X.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on OS X.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.
